			<h1>Functions that are not arrow functions</h1>
			<p>Any function expression or function declaration that changes lexical context, and can be used as a constructor. At the time of writing, the only way to create these, are with the pre-es6 syntax that features the function keyword.</p>
			<h2>Whole function</h2>
			<p></p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h1>Prototype</h1>
			<p>The object that a reliant object delegates to when an attempt is made to access properties that do not exist on the reliant object. At the time of writing, this former object can usually be accessed in a browsers via the nonstandard __proto__ property.</p>
			<h2>Fallback prototype</h2>
			<p>The term fallback prototype should be used when just 'prototype' is ambiguous. In some situations, it may be clear enough just to use the word 'prototype'.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h1>Prototype</h1>
			<p>The property that is present on all whole functions, accessed as a property of a whole function via the key 'prototype'; The property that becomes the fallback prototype of objects that are created with a whole function via the language's built in constructor syntax. (i.e. The 'new' keyword).</p>
			<h2>Resident prototype</h2>
			<p>The term 'prototype' should not be used when discussing this entity, as that term is more often thought of as referring to 'the object that another object delegates to'. Therefore, when talking about this entity, 'Resident prototype' should be used with infrequent exception.</p>
		</div>

		<p>A resident protoype may be considered a fallback prototype, once it becomes linked to an object that has been created with the language's built in constructor syntax, and when it is being considered in the context of the delegating / dependant object (See below).</p>

		<div>
			<h1>Class</h1>
			<p></p>
			<h2>Fallback object (FO)</h2>
			<p></p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h1>Base class</h1>
			<p></p>
			<h2>Base fallback object (B-FO)</h2>
			<p></p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h1>Parent class</h1>
			<p></p>
			<h2>Parent fallback object (P-FO)</h2>
			<p></p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h1>Child class</h1>
			<p></p>
			<h2>Child fallback object (C-FO)</h2>
			<p></p>
		</div>

		<p>All B-FOs, P-FOs, and C-FOs are types of FO.</p>

		<div>
			<h1>Instance of class</h1>

			<h2>Dependant object</h2>
