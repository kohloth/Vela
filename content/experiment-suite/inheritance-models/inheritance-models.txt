Constructor function
A pattern quite unique to javascript whereby functions can have meta properties attached to them and then invoked with the 'new' keyword as a means of establishing property delegation from the produced object to the functions meta property object. Produces a structure that is a bit muddy and unclear.

Object delegation
A cleaner way of achieving what is achieved with the constructor function pattern - by means of explicitly specifying that object a should delegate to object b; by explicitly making one object the prototype of the other.

Class
A syntactical facade designed to give the impression of classical inheritance. The most muddy of all implementations.

Mixin
The practice of taking individual properties from one object, and attaching them to another object - as opposed to linking a whole object to another whole object.
