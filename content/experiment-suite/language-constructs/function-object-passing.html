// Is javascript pass by value or pass by reference?

function adjustNumber(n) {
	n++;
	console.log(`n inside function after being adjusted: ${n}`); // 2
}
let n1 = 1;
adjustNumber(n1);
console.log(`n1 outside function after being adjusted: ${n1}`); // 1
// Therefore, variables holding numbers are passed by value

function adjustObject(o) {
	o.n++;
	console.log(`o.n inside function after being adjusted: ${o.n}`); // 2
}
let o1 = {n: 1};
adjustObject(o1);
console.log(`o1 outside function after being adjusted: ${o1.n}`); // 2
// Therefore, it could be said that objects are passed by reference.

// !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
// However, there is a nuance. When passing an object to a function, it is actually still passed by value,
// and the value that is passed is a reference to the object.
// !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

function changeStuff(a, b, c)
{
	a = a * 10;
	b.item = "changed";
	c = {item: "changed"};
}

var num = 10;
var obj1 = {item: "unchanged"};
var obj2 = {item: "unchanged"};

changeStuff(num, obj1, obj2);

console.log(num); // 10 (unchanged)
console.log(obj1.item); // changed
console.log(obj2.item); // unchanged <-- LOOK

// The reason the last value is unchanged, is because when the code inside the changeStuff
// function is executing, the value of the argument variable c is overridden from being
// a reference to the exernal obj2 variable, and instead becomes a pointer to a new
// value - in this case, a new object. The expression "c = ..." decouples the c
// argument from the external object, assigning it a new value.

// Therefore, javascript is "pass by value", when primatives are concerned.
// Javascript can be generalised as "pass by reference" when objects are concerned.

// However, to be more correct, when objects are concerned, javascript can be described as:
// Reference-by-value
// Call-by-sharing

// This is similar to C# and Java.
