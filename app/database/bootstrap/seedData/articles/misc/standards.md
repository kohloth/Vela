# Bodies

## ICANN and IANA
				
Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers
Internet assigned numbers authority

* IANA was originally responsible for the provisioning of IP addresses, managing DNS etc, but ICANN became the parent company when the job became commercialised in 1998.					

## W3C

World wide web consortium

* Founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee.
* The W3C is responsible for several standards, including HTML, XML, XHTML, WAI-ARIA, DOM, SVG, and CSS.
* The DOM specification defines the HTML node interfaces (such as Node, Element, and HTMLElement) along with their properties and methods.
* The W3C lost much of it's control over respected HTML and DOM standards when insurrection resulted in the formation of  a new standards body, the WHATWG.

## WHATWG

Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group

* Founded in 2004 by individuals from Apple, Mozilla and Opera. Google joined at a later date.
* Was founded in response to the slow pace at which the W3C developed specifications, and as the result in a disagreement over the W3C's advocation of XML over HTML.
* In 2007, the WHATWG proposed to the W3C that the W3C should base it's HTML5 standard on the WHATWG standard, which it did. In 2019, both parties agreed to a memorandum of understanding whereby HTML and DOM specifications would be principally spearheaded by the WHATWG.

The specifications that the WHATWG is responsible for:

* The HTML living standard (AKA continually evolving HTML5).
* The DOM standard, which replaces W3C's DOM Level 3.
* Standards for various web APIs such as web sockets, web workers, fetch, and so on.
* Standards for interpretations, such as how a web browser interprets UTF-8, mimetype sniffing algorithms, and so on.

## Ecma

European computer manufacturers association (formerly)

* Founded in 1961 to standardise computer systems in Europe, but changed it's name to "Ecma International" in 1994 to reflect the global scope of it's work. Membership is open to large and small companies worldwide that produce, market or develop computer systems. Located in Geneva.
* Produces standards through a "business-like approach", claimed to lead to better standards in less time, thanks to less bureaucratic process, based upson consensus.
* Ecma has created around 400 standards. Most of these have been adopted as international standards.
* Ecma also produces technical reports.
* Membership to the ECMA is granted (or refused) after an application letter is sent, a vote is completed, and for most types of membership, a fee is subsequently paid. The fee can be up to £50,000 per year for large companies.

Notable Ecma standards include:

* ECMA-6: 7-bit Coded character set. Based on ASCII. Also approved as ISO/IEC 646.
* ECMA-94: 8-bit encoded character sets. Also approved as ISO/IEC 8859.
* ECMA-107: FAT12/FAT16 Filesystem.
* ECMA-119: CD-ROM volume and filestructure. Also approved as ISO 9660.
* ECMA-125: 3.5" floppy disk.
* ECMA-262: Codified language specification, based on Javascript.
* ECMA-334: C# language specification.
* ECMA-341: Environmental design considerations for electronic products.
* ECMA-376: Open office XML
* ECMA-404: JSON

## TC39

Technical committee 39

* Part of ECMA. Responsible for the standardisation of ECMA-262 (AKA Javascript) in it's pure, ecosystem-agnostic incarnation.
* Specificially, responsible for:
* Identifying and codifying new language syntax and features
* Developing test suites that may be ued to verify correct implementation of the language

The TC39 is made up of “members” who are typically browser vendors and large companies who’ve invested heavily in the web like Facebook and PayPal. To attend the meetings, “members” (again, large companies and browser vendors) will send “delegates” to represent said company or browser. It’s these delegates who are responsible for creating, approving, or denying language proposals.

When a new proposal is created, that proposal has to go through certain stages before it becomes part of the official specification. It’s important to keep in mind that in order for any proposal to move from one stage to another, a consensus among the TC39 must be met. This means that a large majority must agree while nobody strongly disagrees enough to veto a specific proposal.
