Step in and jerk his arm up to release his grip. Turn your body away as you fold his wrist to take him down.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passive ('Joe Style')</td>\n<td>Step diagonally back into ichimonji like kamae to initiate move.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mori No Yokai ('Iyesten Style')</td>\n<td>Check hand and step diagonally back at 45 degrees to initiate move. Lift his arm off your gi and step forwards as you apply the lock, taking him down in the space you created by stepping back.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Explosive 1</td>\n<td>Sink your weight down as you rip his arm off your shirt as usual. Turn your body 180 degrees or more, fast, as you twist his arm around. It will feel like more of a 'throw'.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Explosive 2</td>\n<td>As punch comes in, step back at 45 degrees into a low hoko no kamae. Grab his punching hand and pivot 180 degrees or more etc. This should be quite strongly aerial.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Up./Down. Chi. Takeori.</td>\n<td>Lift his arm up. Step in close to him and apply the omote gyaku principally in a downwards direction. It will be felt on his wrist more and if done right will force him to bend his knees and go directly down.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kogoroshi/Ogoroshi</td>\n<td>Uke Kogoroshi and/or Ogoroshi</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zenpo Tobi Kaiten</td>\n<td>Esentailly an exadgerated Mori No Yokai style Omote Gyaku: Check his hand and step back at 45 degrees as usual but into a&nbsp;<strong>very&nbsp;</strong>low ichimonji. Then jump forwards, fast, far and hard with a zenpo tobi kaithen, while still holding his hand, slamming it into the ground as you land. Continue to roll out.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Opposite step</td>\n<td>Cover his grabbing hand with your hand as usual. Instead of stepping diagonally back and across in the direction towards the side that is grabbed, step diagonally back and to the other side, while turning your body away. It will feel a bit like the start of ura gyaku. Take him down.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Fist</td>\n<td>This time from punch. As punch comes in step to the side (hira no kamae) and let it travel past you as you catch it. (You should have the palm of your hand touching the back of his hand, controlling it. Roll his fingers up and compress his fingers/knuckles/wrist into his forearm. A bit like takeori.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcus' Gyoko Ryu Special</td>\n<td>Check hand. Boshi to pectoral with other hand. Apply pressure to pectoral as you apply omote gyaku witih the other hand. Kick him on the same side as the omote gyaku in the ribs. Fully apply gyaku and take down. Stomp on chest/head etc to finish.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kukishinden Ryu style from punch</td>\n<td>Punch comes in. Jodan Uke, but hold hand at end. Step in and punch at his eyes with other hand. Apply omote gyaku on captive hand.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[Omote Onikudaki]</td>\n<td>Punch comes in. Jodan Uke with left hand. Step in and place right hand under his punching arm into oni kudaki position. Pull down with thumb joint etc and oni kudaki.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[Ura Onikudaki]</td>\n<td>Punch comes in. Jodan Uke with left hand. Do haymaker style punch with right hand, and continue past his face, with your hand coming to rest in the oni kudaki position in his elbow pit. Row oni kudaki. Keep it tight.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

As Toris kick comes in, uke grabs it and performs (omote?) gyaku on ukes foot.</strong></p>\n<h3>Jumonji No Kata</h3>\n<p>Uke punch to face. Tori block, boshi to armpit, hand to eyes: INTENTION. Repeat on other side and end in Kosei. (Which also appears loosely at two other points in this kata)</p>\n<p><strong>Reversal: Uke punch to face. Tori block.

The Koto ryu features 45 degree steps and contrasts with the Gyokko Ryu here again, which favours circular movements (they used to train in hakama 'skirts').</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Punching and kicking</li>\n<li>Jumping</li>\n<li>Soft blocks</li>\n<li>Bone breaking</li>\n<li>45 degree angle stepping</li>\n<li>Use of fudoken</li>\n<li>Kamae: Ichimonji, hira, hoko, bobi seigan</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Striking Waza</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>'Ichimonji no kata': Block with soft block, not strike: open him up. Strong feeling of sinking your weight down as you deliver the shuto</li>\n<li>'Hira no kata': Start in hira, facing uke directly. Punch comes in. Step diagaonally back and sideways (perhaps slightly more sideways), pushing it out the way. (Your palm should touch the back of ukes hand). Deliver ura shuto to back of ukes neck. (Carefully!)</li>\n<li>'Hoko no kata': Start in a lowish hoko. As punch comes in, sink weight and let it go over you.</li>\n<li>Stand up to push it out the way with your arms (but don't move your arms). Then...\n<ul>\n<li>Ura shuto to side of neck</li>\n<li>If distance is better for this, go for omote shuto to other side of neck</li>\n<li>Punch to space between ribs just below nipple</li>\n<li>Punch to floating ribs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>'Bobi no kata': Start in bobi. Punch comes in. Step back at 45 degrees and...\n<ul>\n<li>back more, then step in and punch to solar plexus</li>\n<li>back less, then punch to solar plexus without stepping</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Grappling Waza</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Omote Gyaku: Check hand, step and twist and take hand off. Use forearm as always. Distract hard with free hand. Tear off and take him back to put the lock on. (Rather than spinning). Aruki to get extra distance. Put his wrist all the way to the floor and break.</li>\n<li>Ura Gyaku: Use distraction as arm comes across his face. Put lock on. If possible, put his arm under your armpit to keep your other hand free. As he starts to resist, turn your body the other way and turn it into Omote Gyaku.</li>\n<li>Musha Dori (Muso Dori?): Start with upper sleeve grab. Dip and take his arm, spin to face same direction. Do not kick his leg out. Instead, go down on your outside knee. Lift arms to break shoulder.</li>\n<li>Muso Dori (Musha Dori?): Uke upper arm sleeve grab. Check his elbow with your hand that is on the same side. Step back at 45 degrees on that same side, sink your weight nice and low. Lift with your legs as you rotate his arm by pushing his elbow round and over. Stand more upright as you put both your hands on his elbow. (Break arm). He should be a bit bent over. Kick to his kneepit, stomping his kneecap into the ground. Put arm bar on fully to get him flat to the ground. Hold elbow to ground as you lift up his arm to break elbow again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>More Striking Waza</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Kumiuchi. Take kuzushi and turn non kicking leg slightly to guard crotch. Swing leg up into ukes crotch. As leg swings back down, plant it quite far back. Then palm to chin using hand that is opposite to leg.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"tips\">\n<h3>Tips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fudoken is done with top two knuckles</li>\n<li>Always try to strike and not push in training. A strike can be soft, but it is still a strike. Take his space with it.</li>\n<li>What I previously thought was Musha Dori is in fact Muso Dori and vice versa.</li>\n<li>When doing Muso Dori (the arm through elbow pit to weak spot etc) go back on your knee that is on the outside as it will serve as a guard.</li>\n<li>When doing arm locks, lift him up with your body to put pressure on the elbow, not with your arms.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

Leap backwards and into kamae.</p>\n<h3>Two (Santo 2?)</h3>\n<p>Uke left foot forwards, tori right foot forwards. (Mirror). Uke in bobi, and lunges with knife and toris stomach. Tori pivots round to avoid strike, on the inside. Hand nearest knife checks wrist. Other hand nearest ukes body punches ukes bicep, then ukes hand. Ura gyaku, then halfway through, kick to inside of ukes thigh. Take down to mat.</p>\n<h3>Three</h3>\n<p>ehh...</p>\n<h3>Four (Koto no kata)</h3>\n<p>Uke daijodan cut. Tori moves to outside (hira-like). Tori checks knife hand with hand closest to knife. With other hand (closest to ukes body), shuto down into Lung 5. (Not straight down, come in at an angle to get kyusho). Hop around to front of uke, and strike up and into ukes ears with double happa ken. Finish with kick to groin.</p>\n<div class=\"tips\">\n<h3>Tips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some kyusho. Lung 5: Upper arm on outside. Pericardium 6: wrist. Stomach 9: Pulse point on neck.</li>\n<li>Pressure points don't have to be hit hard. Only accurately and in the right direction. For example, up and in or down and in for the floating rib (busometsu?) and up and into the femur for the one on the inside of the leg a knees height above the knee. For the bicep, hit the centre, inbetween where the bicep divides into two. For the top of the forearm, hit slightly to the inside or slightly to the outside to target one of the points explicitly, and not just the largeish muscle.</li>\n<li>Ichimonji no kata: Strike with body, not just arm</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

The idea this is trying to instill is that it is inconspicuous to hide all your kamae inside shizen.</p>\n<p>Exercise 2: Tori begins by approaching and throwing strike at Uke. This is unusual for the Tori to begin by attacking. Uke moves out of range and guards at last minute, countering with another strike. Tori blocks, and moves in for a feigned strike, in actuality then going for a target elsewhere. The rules of opposing quarters applies strongly here.</p>\n<h3>Jacket Techniques</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold both corners of your jacket, one bit in each hand. Do daken uke on each side while holding it, to begin removing your jacket.</li>\n<li>Punch comes in, basic daken uke. Then reach over ukes hitting hand with your non-blocking hand and grab the bottom of his jacket. Lift it over his arm for armbar or lift it over his head entirely to blind him.</li>\n<li>Punch comes in, passive block. (Step to side letting it travel past you, facing it throughout, then check with your back hand.)

It takes the form of OS on one axis, and browser along the other.</li>\r\n\t<li>Events originate from an event loop, which is initiated and managed by the browser.</li>\r\n\t<li></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>Debugging</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Breakpoints may be used instead of console.log</li>\r\n\t<li>Some JS unit testing frameworks: Qunit, JSUnit, Selenium. These 3 are perhaps the most popular ones.</li>\r\n\t<li>Testing suites must be able to test functions which have async aspects to them.</li>\r\n\t<li>Performance analysis is commonly done in javascript by running a function several times, (i.e. 100 - 5000), and measuring how long the process took.</li>\r\n\t<li>Debugging browsers with lacklustre built-in developer tools can be done by means of utilising firebug, and, in some cases (when fatal errors do not halt the script) posting javascript error messages to the server with AJAX. Mobile devices typically allow debugging through tethering.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>Functions</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Javasscript is a functional programming language. In javascript, objects are ubiquitous. However, something that is perhaps more important than objects in javascript, is the function. Functions are first class citizens in javascript, meaning that they can be treated like any other javascript object. They can be referenced by variables, declared with literals, passed as function parameters, returned from functions.</li>\r\n\t<li>A functions name attribute stores the name of a function. When declared as function foo, it will be foo. When declared as var foo = function, however, it will be an empty string.</li>\r\n\t<li>The arguments paramter is not actually a fully-fleged array, but merely acts like one in many ways. However, it can be quite easily converted into a fully fleged array with: Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);</li>\r\n\t<li>Object methods can be named using named anonymous functions, (fig 1) to help resolve scoping issues.</li>\r\n\t<li>At the expense of becoming harder to test, functions can benefit from performance gains by becoming self momoizing. i.e. By caching results within themselves for faster subsequent lookups. (fig 2). This works particularly well with AJAX results and DOM element traversals.</li>\r\n\t<li>Overloading functions can be done quite elegantly with a few tricks: (fig 3)</li>\r\n</ul> \r\n<p>Fig 1</p>\r\n<pre><code>var foo = {\r\n\tdoSomething: function doStuff() {\r\n\t\tdoStuff();\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>Fig 2</p>\r\n<pre><code>var getAccount = function(id) {\r\n\tif (!this.cache) this.cache = {};\r\n\tif (this.cache[id] != null) return this.cache[id];\r\n\tfunction getAccountAjax(id) {\r\n\t\t// do ajaxy stuff\r\n\t\t// return account object\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn this.cache[id] = getAccountAjax(id);\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>Fig 3</p>\r\n<pre><code>function addMethod(object, name, fn) {\r\n\tvar old = object[name];\r\n\tobject[name] = function(){\r\n\t\tif (fn.length == arguments.length)\r\n\t\t\treturn fn.apply(this, arguments)\r\n\t\telse if (typeof old == 'function')\r\n\t\t\treturn old.apply(this, arguments);\r\n\t};\r\n}\r\nvar ninja = {};\r\naddMethod(ninja,'whatever',function(){ /* do something */ });\r\naddMethod(ninja,'whatever',function(a){ /* do something else */ });\r\naddMethod(ninja,'whatever',function(a,b){ /* yet something else */ });\r\n</code></pre>",
